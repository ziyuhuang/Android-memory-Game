6. The app has not error if not to save the states. I haven’t not completely finish the  
   game which to save the state by share preference. There are partial implementation 
   working, save the points and the count. Image state can not be save in this moment. 
   If you want to test it. Go the the Play.java file and comment the “clearPreference()” 
   and uncomment the “savePreference()” in the “onCreate” function. If and error comes up, 
   run the clearPreference one time first. Ops~ Thanks
